## Local Politician Finder

Local Politician Finder is an angular app that hits Google's Civic Information API in order to display information about politicians in a given area.

## TODOs
Future features will be to query Open Secret's API in order to display the amount of money a politician has received from lobbyists and money received in campaign contributions.
